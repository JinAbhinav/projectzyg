    "title": "Exploitation of Log4Shell (CVE-2021-44228)",
    "description": "A critical remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability, identified as CVE-2021-44228 (Log4Shell), was found in the Apache Log4j logging library. Attackers are actively exploiting this vulnerability in the wild. The exploit involves sending a specially crafted string which, when logged by a vulnerable application using Log4j, triggers a JNDI lookup. This allows attackers to load and execute arbitrary Java code from an attacker-controlled server. Observed impacts include deployment of ransomware, crypto miners, and Cobalt Strike beacons.",
