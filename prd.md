## Project Name: SEER

**Full Name:** Security Early Event Radar

**Category:** Cyber Threat Intelligence System

**Project Type:** College-level cybersecurity capstone (safe, research-based)

**Objective:** To develop a proactive cyber threat prediction and alerting system that leverages dark web crawling, AI-powered NLP, threat enrichment, network sniffing, and machine learning to identify and forecast cyberattacks.

---

## 1. Executive Summary

SEER is an AI-driven early warning system that identifies, classifies, and forecasts cyber threats by combining multi-source threat intelligence (dark web forums, marketplaces, leak sites) with real-time network packet sniffing and anomaly detection. It enables security professionals and researchers to stay ahead of evolving threats by providing actionable insights through predictive modeling and an interactive dashboard.

## 2. Key Features

### 2.1 Dark Web & Deep Web Crawling

- Use of **Crawl4AI** or alternatives (OnionCrawler, Scrapy + Tor)
- Target forums, paste sites, Telegram groups, and marketplaces
- Extract IOCs: Leaked credentials, malware, exploits, C2 infra

### 2.2 NLP + LLM Threat Parsing

- Semantic analysis of scraped content using transformers (BERT/GPT models)
- Entity extraction: threat actor names, malware types, target organizations
- Sentiment classification (intent, urgency, probability of attack)

### 2.3 Threat Intelligence Enrichment

- Cross-reference data with:
  - **HaveIBeenPwned API**
  - **AlienVault OTX**
  - **MISP** and **AbuseIPDB**
- Validate severity, credibility, and novelty of threats

### 2.4 Predictive Modeling (ML)

- Time-series modeling (LSTM, Prophet) for forecasting attack trends
- Predict likely sectors, attack types, and timelines

### 2.5 Real-time Alert Engine

- **Purpose:** Proactively notify users about high-priority threats or anomalies detected by the SEER pipeline.
- **Alert Triggers:** Alerts can be triggered based on configurable conditions, including:
    - **High Severity/Confidence Threats:** Detection of threats (from NLP/LLM parser or enrichment) exceeding predefined severity (e.g., CRITICAL, HIGH) and/or confidence thresholds.
    - **Specific IOC Matches:** Configurable rules to alert if specific indicators (IPs, domains, hashes, CVEs) are detected during crawling or enrichment.
    - **Network Anomalies:** Alerts generated by the Network Sniffing module based on detected suspicious patterns (e.g., potential C2 communication, data exfiltration signatures) exceeding a risk score.
    - **Predictive Thresholds:** Alerts based on ML model predictions (e.g., forecasted spike in a specific attack type targeting a relevant sector).
    - **Keyword Monitoring:** (Optional) Alerts based on specific keywords appearing in crawled content.
- **Configuration:**
    - **UI Interface:** Users can configure alert rules, thresholds, and notification channels via the Dashboard.
    - **Rule Granularity:** Define rules based on threat type, severity, confidence score, data source, specific IOCs, or keywords.
    - **Channel Selection:** Choose one or more notification methods per rule (Email, Slack, generic Webhook).
- **Notification Channels:**
    - **Email:** Send formatted alert emails using SMTP.
    *   **Slack:** Post alert messages to configured Slack channels via Slack Incoming Webhooks.
    *   **Generic Webhook:** Send a JSON payload containing alert details to a user-defined webhook URL.
- **Alert Content:** Notifications should include key information:
    - Alert Type (Threat Detected, Network Anomaly, Prediction, etc.)
    - Threat Title / Anomaly Description
    - Severity / Risk Score
    - Timestamp
    - Source (e.g., Crawl URL, Network Interface)
    - Key Indicators (IPs, CVEs, Hashes etc.)
    - Link back to the relevant view in the SEER Dashboard.
- **Debouncing/Throttling:** Implement mechanisms to prevent alert fatigue:
    - Group similar alerts occurring within a short time window.
    - Rate limit notifications per channel or per rule.
- **Implementation Notes:**
    - Can leverage a background task queue (like Celery with Redis/RabbitMQ) for reliable alert dispatching.
    - Requires secure storage of credentials/API keys for notification services.

### 2.6 Interactive Dashboard

- Built with **React.js + TailwindCSS**
- Live threat map, historical charts, filters (date/type/severity)
- IOC search, case view, and export (PDF/JSON)

### 2.7 Network Sniffing & Local Threat Detection

- Packet inspection using **Scapy**/**PyShark**
- Detect:
  - Suspicious IP/domain access
  - Exfiltration behavior
  - Malware communication attempts
- Signature + anomaly-based hybrid detection
- Correlate sniffed data with crawled threat signals
