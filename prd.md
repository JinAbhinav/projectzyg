# 📄 Product Requirements Document (PRD)  
## 🛡️ Project: SEER – AI-Powered Cyber Threat Prediction & Early Warning System  

---

## 1. 🧠 Overview

**SEER** is an advanced cybersecurity tool that leverages **AI, threat intelligence, and deep web crawling** to detect and predict cyber threats before they escalate into attacks. It continuously scans the **surface web, deep web, and dark web** for indicators of compromise (IOCs), using machine learning to **predict trends**, and **notifies organizations and individuals in real-time**.

## 2. 🎯 Goals

| Objective | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| 🔍 Threat Intelligence | Detect early indicators of cyberattacks through dark web and deep web data. |
| 🤖 Predictive Defense | Forecast cyberattacks using pattern recognition and past threat data. |
| ⚠️ Real-Time Alerts | Notify users when they are likely to be targeted or their data is compromised. |
| 🧩 Integrations | Seamlessly connect with security systems (SIEMs, firewalls, email, Slack, APIs). |

## 3. 🧩 Key Features

### 3.1 🌐 Deep/Dark Web Intelligence using Crawl4AI  
- Crawl dark web forums, Telegram channels, paste sites, hacker marketplaces, onion sites.  
- Leverage **Crawl4AI** for deep recursive link traversal and NLP enrichment.  
- Auto-detect keywords related to:  
  - Leaked credentials  
  - Malware listings  
  - Exploit kits  
  - Targeted organizations or IPs  
  - Zero-day vulnerabilities  

### 3.2 🧠 AI-Powered NLP Analysis  
- Use LLMs (GPT-4 or LLaMA) + spaCy/NLTK for semantic tagging.  
- Classify documents/posts into threat categories: Phishing, DDoS, Ransomware, Exploit Trading, etc.  
- Generate metadata: confidence score, severity, potential targets.  
- Create embeddings for clustering similar threats.

### 3.3 📊 Threat Trend Prediction  
- ML models trained on datasets like:  
  - MITRE ATT&CK  
  - CISA alerts  
  - MISP (Malware Information Sharing Platform)  
- Detect anomaly patterns in attack behavior.  
- Forecast threat surges using time-series forecasting (ARIMA/LSTM models).

### 3.4 📢 Real-Time Notification Engine  
- Triggers based on severity/confidence thresholds.  
- Sends notifications to:  
  - Email  
  - Slack/Webhooks  
  - Custom API endpoints  
- Optional: SMS or push notifications.

### 3.5 🖥️ Web-Based Intelligence Dashboard  
- Built with React.js + TailwindCSS.  
- Displays:  
  - Threat heatmaps  
  - Timeline graphs of trending threats  
  - Live feed of discovered IOCs  
  - System status & alerts  
- Includes filtering (region, industry, threat type).

### 📦 Modules Breakdown

| Module | Functionality |
|--------|---------------|
| `crawler.py` | Interface to Crawl4AI, configured with keywords, recursion limits, and content handlers. |
| `nlp_engine.py` | Tokenizes, tags, embeds, and classifies text using spaCy/transformers. |
| `predictor.py` | ML model for anomaly detection and forecasting based on threat evolution. |
| `alert_dispatcher.py` | Formats alert objects and sends them via email, webhook, or Slack. |
| `dashboard/` | React + Flask backend for live visualization and user interaction. |

---

## 5. 🔐 Security & Compliance

- Ensure crawling respects legal boundaries (use vetted, open-source dark web monitors).  
- Log all activities and protect user data with AES-256 encryption.  
- Comply with GDPR, CCPA (no personally identifiable data stored without consent).  
- All backend services served over HTTPS.

- Historic breach data (Kaggle + open threat databases)

---

## 8. 🔄 User Stories

| Role | Action | Outcome |
|------|--------|---------|
| Analyst | Receives alert on new exploit found in dark web | Patches systems before threat goes live |
| Security Lead | Views dashboard with regional threats | Adjusts firewall rules |
| DevOps | Gets Slack ping for leaked credential | Resets keys and enforces MFA |
| Researcher | Analyzes trends in threat heatmap | Prepares cyber-risk whitepaper |

---

## 9. ✅ Success Metrics

- 🟢 90%+ precision on threat classification (after tuning).  
- ⏱️ < 30 seconds average alert latency.  
- 📉 Reduction in unpredicted attacks for simulated orgs.  
- 🧠 Trained model correctly forecasts attack waves at least 3–5 days ahead.

---

## 10. 📈 Stretch Goals

- Add browser extension to alert users while they browse vulnerable platforms.  
- Feed outputs into open CTI platforms like MISP.  
- Include a plug-in for SIEMs (like Splunk/ELK integration).  
- Anomaly detection on network traffic logs to correlate with dark web chatter.
