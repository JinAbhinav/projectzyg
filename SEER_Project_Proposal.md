# Project SEER: Next-Generation Threat Intelligence Platform

## 1. Introduction: The Challenge of a Dynamic Threat Landscape

In today's interconnected digital world, organizations face a relentless barrage of cyber threats. From sophisticated APT groups to opportunistic ransomware gangs and ever-evolving malware, the threat landscape is dynamic and complex. To effectively defend against these threats, security teams require timely, accurate, and actionable intelligence. However, gathering and processing this intelligence from diverse sources—ranging from clearnet security blogs and forums to the hidden corners of the dark web—is a monumental task. Existing solutions are often siloed, expensive, or lack the agility to adapt to new threat vectors.

## 2. Project SEER: Illuminating the Shadows

Project SEER (Strategic Engine for Early-warning Reconnaissance) is a next-generation threat intelligence platform designed to empower security professionals by automating the discovery, processing, and analysis of cyber threat information from a multitude of sources, including the dark web. By integrating advanced web crawling capabilities with powerful NLP-driven threat parsing, SEER aims to provide a clear, consolidated, and actionable view of the evolving threat landscape.

## 3. Core Capabilities & Features

*   **Hybrid Web Crawling Engine:**
    *   **Clearnet & Dark Web (.onion) Access:** SEER can systematically scrape data from standard websites and Tor hidden services, accessing crucial information often missed by conventional tools.
    *   **Anti-Detection & Stealth:** Leverages advanced techniques (e.g., via Botasaurus integration) to minimize detection and bypass anti-bot measures, ensuring comprehensive data collection.
    *   **Flexible Scraper Selection:** Users can choose between fast, direct text extraction for simple sites or full browser rendering for JavaScript-heavy pages, optimizing for speed and accuracy.
    *   **Tor Integration:** Built-in Tor proxying for anonymous and secure access to sensitive sources.

*   **Intelligent Threat Parsing & Extraction:**
    *   **LLM-Powered Analysis:** Utilizes state-of-the-art Large Language Models (via OpenAI) to analyze crawled text content and extract structured threat intelligence.
    *   **Standardized Output:** Parses information into a defined, consistent JSON schema (based on `threat_template.json`), identifying key elements such as:
        *   Threat Titles & Descriptions
        *   Threat Types (Malware, Phishing, Ransomware, etc.)
        *   Severity & Confidence Levels
        *   MITRE ATT&CK Tactics & Techniques
        *   Threat Actors (Names, Aliases, Motivations)
        *   Indicators of Compromise (IOCs: CVEs, IPs, URLs, Hashes, Domains)
        *   Affected Systems & Software
        *   Mitigation Strategies & References
    *   **Automated IOC Extraction:** Pre-populates a structured IOC schema, ready for population by the NLP engine.

*   **Centralized Data Management & Storage:**
    *   **Supabase Integration:** Securely stores parsed threat intelligence in a robust Supabase PostgreSQL database.
    *   **Local Archiving:** Maintains local archives of raw crawled data (Markdown files) and parsed threat JSONs for auditing and offline analysis.

*   **Asynchronous Task Management & Scalability:**
    *   **RQ (Redis Queue):** Employs a distributed task queue system to handle crawl jobs asynchronously, ensuring the platform is responsive and scalable.
    *   **Dedicated Worker Services:** Offloads intensive crawling and parsing tasks to dedicated worker instances, allowing the API to remain performant.

*   **User-Friendly Interface & API:**
    *   **Web Dashboard:** Provides an intuitive interface (built with React/Shadcn UI) for:
        *   Initiating single and multi-URL crawl jobs.
        *   Selecting scraper types.
        *   Monitoring job status in real-time.
        *   Viewing and searching crawl results and parsed threat intelligence.
    *   **FastAPI Backend:** Offers a robust and well-documented API for programmatic interaction and integration with other security tools.

*   **Proactive Alerting (Integrated):**
    *   **Rule-Based Evaluation:** Automatically evaluates extracted threat data against user-defined alert rules to flag critical or relevant threats.

## 4. Technical Architecture Overview

*   **Frontend:** React, Shadcn UI, Axios
*   **Backend API:** FastAPI (Python)
*   **Web Crawling:** Botasaurus (Python), Selenium/Playwright (via Botasaurus)
*   **Task Queue:** RQ (Redis Queue), Redis
*   **NLP/Threat Parsing:** OpenAI GPT models, Custom Python logic
*   **Database:** Supabase (PostgreSQL)
*   **Containerization:** Docker, Docker Compose
*   **Proxying:** Tor

## 5. Value Proposition & Benefits

*   **Enhanced Situational Awareness:** Provides a broader and deeper view of threats by tapping into both clearnet and dark web sources.
*   **Early Warning & Proactive Defense:** Identifies emerging threats and IOCs sooner, allowing for timely mitigation.
*   **Increased Efficiency:** Automates the laborious process of manual data collection and initial analysis, freeing up security analysts for higher-value tasks.
*   **Actionable Intelligence:** Transforms raw data into structured, easy-to-understand threat intelligence that can be directly used for incident response, threat hunting, and strategic planning.
*   **Customizable & Extensible:** Built with modern, flexible technologies, allowing for future enhancements and integrations.
*   **Data-Driven Security Decisions:** Empowers organizations to make more informed security decisions based on comprehensive and timely intelligence.

## 6. Target Use Cases

*   **Security Operations Centers (SOCs):** Augmenting threat feeds, identifying new IOCs, and providing context for alerts.
*   **Threat Intelligence Teams:** Automating data collection from diverse sources, including difficult-to-reach forums and hidden services.
*   **Incident Response Teams:** Quickly gathering intelligence related to ongoing incidents.
*   **Vulnerability Management:** Identifying discussions around new exploits and vulnerabilities.
*   **Brand Protection:** Monitoring for mentions and threats related to an organization's assets.

## 7. Future Roadmap (Potential Enhancements)

*   Advanced IOC correlation and enrichment.
*   Integration with more threat intelligence feeds and security tools (e.g., SIEMs, SOAR platforms).
*   Trend analysis and predictive threat modeling.
*   User-configurable NLP extraction prompts and models.
*   Enhanced dark web source discovery and management.
*   Visualizations and reporting dashboards.
